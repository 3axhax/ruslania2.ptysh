            Ruslania Books Corp. - for everyone interested in Russia and Russian culture
            </div>

            Ruslania Books Corp. was founded in 1986 in Helsinki, Finland. It is a 100 % Finnish family owned business. The company was founded in order to publish a “Finnish-Russian agricultural dictionary”. After that Ruslania has published three dictionaries and Mika Waltari’s “Sinuhe” in Russian. <br><br>

Now, Ruslania is one of the largest whole sellers and distributors of Russian books, films, music and periodicals. The company also has probably the largest selection of Russian sheet music titles in the World outside Russia. <br><br>

Since the market in Finland is limited, Ruslania has been developing it’s international business strongly in recent years. The book store has customers in all continents. Thanks to their strategic location in Finland, the company has good connections to Russia as well as very quick and reliable deliveries to all countries. <br><br>

Ruslania is tightly focused to distribute Russian products. The selection also has products in other languages, but they all must have something to do with Russia. For example books translated from Russian and Russian business contact catalogues. Thanks to focusing, Ruslania can offer very high standard of service to both corporate and private customers. <br><br>

The company structure is very simple and there are no high costs for bureaucracy. This can be seen first of all in the pricing. Secondly, Ruslania can offer much more personal service than most of its competitors. Ruslania’s customer service is always ready and willing to take telephone calls. <br><br>

In 2007, Ruslania has actively widened its business on the amazon.com Marketplace. The company is now the leading supplier of Russian products to the amazon system.
<br><br>
Ruslania Books Corporation is specialized in the following products:
<br><br>
Books<br>
Ruslania started as a book store. That is why books are the very core of the business. The company has a big selection of dictionaries, text books, militaria books, art books etc. Fiction and non-fiction selections are very closely being kept up-to-date.  
<br><br>
Periodicals<br>
The periodicals division is proudly offering over 5.000 Russian periodical titles. Ruslania also has a network with East-European subscription dealers, that offer periodicals in other Slavic languages. The periodicals division does a lot of detective work to find the needed periodicals for its customers. The prices for subscriptions are being kept on a moderate level. In case of any undelivered issues, replacement copies are sent.
<br><br>
Sheet music<br>
Ruslania’s sheet music collection is, without doubt, the most interesting one in the whole World outside Russia. The sheet music department has good connections with some of the largest and the most active Russian sheet music publishers. Add to that co-operation with big whole sellers and specialized music stores and you will see a unique importing system. Ruslania uses its expertize in languages to translate titles and tables of contents from Russian to other languages. This widens the circle of users.
<br><br>
Films<br>
A big issue when dealing with DVD films is the region code classification. Ruslania would like to keep a very various selection of films. But not all films published in Russia are suitable for “All region”. This is why the current selection consists of a majority of films for “All region”. Some films come for region code 5 (Russia) and some for region code 2 (Finland). However, all films can be watched on a DVD compatible computer.
<br><br>

Music<br>
Ruslania has Ukrainean pop music as well as a very large and wide selection of Russian pop and classical music. Thanks to the company’s specialists, the selection has always the newest and the favourite CDs.
<br><br>
Maps<br>
Electronic GPS-maps are offered for Garmin devices. Ruslania is the leading importer of these products from Russia to Finland and to the EU. Printed maps and wall maps are well presented, too.
<br><br>
Posters, post cards, stamps, calendars etc. <br>
Ruslania has many years of experience in importing and translating Russian propaganda posters and post cards. These items are very popular amongst the customers of the book store in Helsinki. Ruslania has a lot of authentic stamps from the Soviet era. New calendars are added the selection in the end of each year.
<br><br>
Software<br>
Ruslania offers translation software, contact catalogues, tools for Russian language proofing, dictionaries, electronic translators etc.
