                may vary from 2 to 20 working days, depending on whether the book/item is in stock or not. All the delivery
		times indicated  during ordering process are estimated and can not be guaranteed.

    <b>5.3</b> In the event of an exceptionally long term of delivery Ruslania shall without delay inform the Customer 
        about this by e-mail. The Customer has the right to cancel his order, if the item/title should be delivered within 
        an exceptionally long term. Ruslania retains the right to cancel a placed order if a title is out of print/out 
        of stock, or it is exceptionally difficult to attain. In such a case the Customer will be offered a similar product to
         replace the out-of-stock one or the Customer may reserve the sum he has paid for future purchases.

    <br><br>

    <b>5.4</b> Should an order include more than one item with different terms of delivery, the order will normally 
        be despatched not until all items are ready for shipment. The delivery may, however, be divided into two 
        or several parties at the discretion of the Customer service. In case of a mail delivery in several parties, the 
        postage shall usually be charged only once (during the first shipment).
  
  <br><br>
  <b>6. Liability (disclaimer)</b>
  <br><br>

  Ruslania assumes no liability whatsoever for any direct, incidental, consequential or indirect damage, arising to the Customer 
    out of the product, non-acceptance of the order, or delay of shipment. Neither shall Ruslania assume any liability 
    whatsoever for the content of any material or resource in the periodical or any damage arising out of them, since such 
    liability is on the manufacturer or the publisher. Similarly, all liability concerning copyright is on the manufacturer or the 
    publisher.

  <br><br>
  <b>7. Return Policy</b>
  <br><br>

    <b>7.1</b> According to the Finnish Consumer Protection Act, any goods mailed to a private citizen may be

    via the Internet.

    <br><br>

                  usage. Any return shall be settled with our Customer service (see <a href="http://www.ruslania.com/context-584/entity-1/language-1.html">Contacts</a>).

                 Any return from abroad shall be settled with the Customer service in advance.


  <br><br>
  <b>8. Claims</b>
  <br><br>

  In the event of a mistaken delivery (wrong title or item with flaw or damage), the Customer shall notify Ruslania as soon as 
    possible. A damaged item shall, as a rule, be replaced by delivering a flawless item. If this is not possible, a discount or 
    another item may be  discussed to settle the matter.

  <br><br>
  <b>9. Force majeure</b>
  <br><br>
  
  Ruslania shall not assume liability for non-delivery or delay of delivery of items, if caused by force majeure conditions 
   (acts of God, calamities, strikes, terrorist acts, sabotage, suspension of traffic or energy supply, export or import prohibition,
   acts of government officials etc., which have significantly jeopardized the operations of Ruslanian or its partners). Ruslania 
   will try to notify the Customer as soon as possible on the entry of such conditions into force.
  <br><br>
  <b>10. Settlement of disputes</b>
  <br><br>
    Disputes and conflicts concerning contracts and their conditions between Ruslania and its Customers shall be settled primarily 
    by amicable negotiations. If a settlement cannot be reached, the disputes may be appealed to the Helsinki Disctrict Court 
    of Justice. The settlement shall be governed by Finnish law.
