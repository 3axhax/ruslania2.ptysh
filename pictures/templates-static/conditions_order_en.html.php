<b>HOW TO PLACE AN ORDER</b>

  <br>

<b>How to use the shopcart</b>
<br><br>
Should You - as we hope - come across something interesting on our site, please click <b>Add to shopcart</b> to reserve the interesting item for purchase. The item "enters" the shopcart and stays there, unless You delete it. To delete an item just click "Delete" and <b>Refresh shopcart</b>. It is fairly easy to use the shopcart: should You not wish to place an order at once, the program "memorizes" the contents of the shopcart, and, when You revisit the site, You will be able to review your shopcart and renew/refresh the contents. You can check the contents of the shopcart any time by clicking "My shopcart" on the left panel of the site. It is also possible to accumulate items in the shopcart, and, to place an order at a later date. By doing so You will be able to save on shipping costs, however, by accumulating items for a long time You may miss some of them, because we may run out of some items by the time You eventually order them.
<br><br>
<b>Quantity</b>
<br>
Should You wish to order a certain amount of a particular item, please enter the necessary number of goods to the box under the word <b> Quantity</b> and click <b>Refresh shopcart</b>. If You enter the number 0, the item will be deleted from the shopcart.
<br><br>
<b>Return</b>
<br>
If You have mistaken in Your choice of the number of items, by using the key "Return" You may return to the initial position even if You have already clicked <b>Place an order</b>.
<br><br>

<b>PLACING AN ORDER</b>
<br><br>

<b>First step: checking the contents of the shopcart</b>
<br>
Having picked all necessary items to the shopcart, You start placing an order by pressing the key <b> Place an order</b>. The steps of placing an order will be suggested/prompted for You coherently. In the end of the procedure You will be suggested/prompted to check all the parameters of Your order (composition of the order, method of shipment, method of payment etc.). In case of discrepancies, You will be able to return to any of the previous steps of ordering and change the parameters of the order. Any items in the shopcart will be included in the order in the amount selected by You for each of them. If everything is all right, click Place an order.
<br><br>

<b>Second step: Choose the delivery type</b>
We offer you two methods to receive the desired products. 
<br>*to fetch the order at Ruslania's shop at Helsinki, Bulevardi 7 
<br>*to deliver the order by post
To select, click on one of the options.
Now, the next step will appear.
<br>
<br>

<b>Third step: Choice of delivery address</b>
<br>
  Items may be shipped either to the main address indicated by You when registering, or to any other address indicated by You. You may also indicate the name and address of another person, should You, e.g. purchase an item as a gift. <br>

  This, however, shall be indicated separately (field Special wishes) later on during the order procedure). Please note, that shipment outside the European Union shall be VAT-exclusive, and therefore, if You indicate a non-EU country,
  the price of the order shall be reduced by the sum of VAT (VAT=0%). In this case the parcel might get stuck in the local customs and the Buyer might need to pay taxes in his own country when receiving the shipment. <br>

  For packages with items in a total value under $100, there is usually nothing extra to be paid. However, this varies regionally. For further information please refer to the local customs office. If you see the address you want to use for delivery, please click the address. Otherwise, please click <b>Add another delivery address. </b>
<br>
<br>


<b>Fourth step: Choice of payer's address</b><br>

If you see the address you want to use as the payer's address, please click the address. In most cases, it is the same as the delivery address. Otherwise, please click <b>"Add another billing address. </b><br>
<br>



<b>Fifth step: Delivery type</b>
<br>

You will be suggested 3 alternative methods of shipment: Express, Priority, and Economy. The difference between the price of these is significant, and we recommend to compare the alternatives and select the best option. If You want to pick up the products in our bookshop in Helsinki, then select the option <b> I want to fetch the order at Ruslania's shop</b> on the second step of the order process. By doing so You will save the cost of mailing and parcel handling. In this case the products will be reserved for You and waiting for You to pick them up during one week.
<br><br>

<b>Sixth step: Notes and confirmation of the order</b><br>

Here, you can give us any <b>Wishes concerning the order</b>, for example, you can indicate the name and address of another person as the recipient if you're purchasing an item as a gift. <br>
<br>


Please confirm your order contents. You can open the terms of use by clicking the underlined <b>terms of use</b>. After you tick to agree, the <b>Submit order </b> button will become clickable. Click to submit your order. <br>
<br>



Now the order is finalized and will appear on the Ruslania's orders system. <br>
<br>


<b>Payment</b>
<br>

Please tick on of the payment options and click <b>Confirm the payment type</b>.<br>


If you choose an online payment system, You will be referred to the closed site of the chosen system of payment. Having done this, You will return to Ruslania's site, where You will be told at once whether Your payment has been accepted or not. In case of acceptance of the payment, You will be able to continue Your presence on our site, or to exit. If the payment for some reason has not been accepted, You may try again to affect payment. There is no danger of double payment, since electronic banking systems do not accept two similar sums during the same day. <br>


You may pay for Your order by using <a href="https://www.paytrail.com/en/for-consumers-paytrail" target="new" class="maintxt23">Paytrail</a>, which accepts payments with electronic banking of Finnish and Scandinavian banks, Visa and MasterCard/Eurocard (Credit/Debit), Visa Electron, Maestro, Diners and American Express or the international online payment system <a href="http://www.paypal.com" class="maintxt23" target="new">Paypal</a>. The Danish Dankort is accepted when it has a credit card functionality. <br>
<br>
<b>Remember me</b>
<br><br>You may choose to use the Remember me functionality at Paytrail's payment page, when you are paying for your order at Ruslania. This feature will make future online payments smoother. This feature will be automatically offered for all our customers who use card payments via Paytrail. <br>How does it work?<br>The customer is given the option on the card payment page to securely save their card details; thereafter the customer can pay easily in more than 25,000 online stores in the Nordic countries by simply entering the three-digit verification code of their card (CVV2/CVC2). In Finland, the card holder may also have to authenticate themselves via the TUPAS service should the card issuer require it. The supported cards are Visa and Mastercard. In the future, both regular customers and first time customers will have a smoother payment experience.<br>How does this affect my shopping at online stores?<br>Once the Remember me functionality is activated, it will display on the payment page. No action is required from the user and Remember me's use is not obligatory.<br><br>

<b>Payment to Ruslania's bank account</b><br>
You may also pay for Your order to Ruslania's bank account. You will find the necessary banking information on the page of the payment. Also, payments in USD checks are accepted. Check payments in other currencies than USD are not accepted. If You pay by credit or debit card, use electronic banking services or pay with USD check, the order will be shipped immediately after we receive the verification of payment. 

Both corporate clients and individuals may be invoiced. We offer delivery without prepayment to such European corporate clients, that have an European VAT id number. Finnish customers will receive an invoice along with the ordered goods (inside the package). Ruslania retains the right to request an advance payment. In case of a non-Finnish customer, Ruslania requires an advance payment. In this case we will first send an e-mail message with the payment instructions. The order will be shipped as soon as the payment has been registered on our bank account (if the ordered titles are in stock). In international payments we recommend using the <A class="maintxt23" HREF="http://www.ruslania.com/download/HTML/IBAN-ENG.htm" target="new">IBAN-number (International Bank Account Number)</A> in order to minimize the extra banking fees. We reserve the right to request an advance payment from Finnish customers according to our consideration. <br>
<br>


Please pay attention to the method of payment and note that for payment via electronic banking systems You need to have a special agreement with the bank; just keeping an account with the bank is not enough! For further information refer to Your bank. <br>
