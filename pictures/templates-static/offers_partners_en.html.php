        My name is Andreas Agopov and I am the CEO of a Helsinki based bookstore Ruslania.com.<br/><br/>

        I'm not sure if you have the information that Ruslania also sells Russian books, Russian magazines and newspapers, Russian music, Russian DVDs, Russian audio books, Estonian books and Finnish books as well as Russian
        music editions of serious music, music book series and composers collected editions.<br/><br/>

        For a better understanding, please let me shortly explain what kind of services the Ruslania provides to resellers.<br/><br/>

        The economic value in Ruslania’s case comes from the work time that the reseller saves, when he uses Ruslania’s services compared to searching for the product from the Russian market himself.<br/><br/>

        Our specialized cataloguers enter all kind of editions which are suitable for our circle of customers into our online search and order database, where they can be directly selected and ordered. This is an effective tool of promotion.<br/><br/>

        Our databases are available to our library customers free of charge for reviewing promotional data like descriptions, for doing collection development work, for selecting, ordering and many other library technical functions.<br/><br/>

        Besides, Ruslania sells editions and additional quantities when our customers react on the New Title Announcements that we send out to them on a regular schedule via e-mail. By way of this we inform registered customers of
        new publications in the area of their interest.<br/><br/>

        All of our services provided to resellers, distributors and customers alike cause expenses. However, we keep the prices on quite a moderate level by constantly developing our processes and our organization as effective as possible.<br/><br/>

        If you are a distributor, a bookshop, a sheet music retailer, a party that would be interested in beginning to distribute Ruslania’s products to your customers, please ask for our special terms for reseller customers.<br/><br/>

        It has always been the Ruslania’s policy to provide materials to our customers at the prices which are way lower than the expected price of a matching product from a local publisher when possible.<br/><br/>

        We would be glad to send you all information regarding our services which could be of interest for you, including information about our general terms and conditions (like payment terms, trade discount, shipping costs ect).<br/><br/>

        Also we would like to send you a newsletter, if you’re interested in the newest arrivals and campaigns.<br/><br/>


        We are looking forward to hearing from you.<br/><br/>

        Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>



        Andreas Agopov<br/>

        CEO<br/>
